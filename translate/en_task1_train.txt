On November, 2016, # 9 CT: Celiac lymph node metastasis after postoperative chemotherapy for ascending colon cancer re-examined, compared with 2016-09-20 tablets: Colonic anastomosis, no definite mass was found. The nodule above Gastric antrum is smaller than before, considering metastasis. Bilateral iliac vessels adjacent to the enlarged lymph nodes, similar to the previous, it is recommended to observe.
